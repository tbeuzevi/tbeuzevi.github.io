I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in numerical error analysis for algorithms in artificial intelligence. I received an Engineering Degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from French [Grande école](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole) [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) in 2020 and completed my PhD thesis in 2024 under the supervision of [Alfredo Buttari](https://abuttari.gitlab.io/), [Théo Mary](https://tmary.perso.lip6.fr/) and [Serge Gratton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q9HdQc4AAAAJ&hl=fr).

The aim of my research is to provide tools to better understand, explain, and predict the sensitivity of artificial neural networks to various types of perturbations. To this end, I extend to artificial neural networks some well-known concepts from numerical linear algebra, such as condition number and backward error, which led to [contributions](/publications/) in adversarial attacks and rounding error analysis, as well as practical applications.
